			<h2>Bangabandhu of Bangladesh</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Mujibr Rahman</b>, also called Sheikh Mujib,(born March 17, 1920, Tungipara, India [now in Bangladesh] - died August 15, 1975, Dhaka, Bangladesh), Bengali leader who became the president (1971-72; 1975) and prime minister (1972-75) of Bangladesh.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mujib, the son of a middle-class landowner, studied law and political science at the Universities of Calcutta and Dacca (now Dhaka). Although jailed briefly as a teenager for agitating for Indian independence, he began his formal political career in 1949 as a cofounder of the Awami League. The league advocated political autonomy for East Pakistan, the detached eastern part of Pakistan. Mujib's arrest in the late 196os incited mob violence that eroded the Pakistani president's authority in East Pakistan. In the elections of December 1970, Mujib's Awami League secured a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, and Mujib demanded independence for East Pakistan. Troops from West Pakistan were sent to regain control of the eastern province but were defeated with the help of India. East Pakistan, renamed Bangladesh, was proclaimed an independent republic in 1971, and in January 1972 Mujib, recentlyreleased from prison, became the first prime minister intalled under the country's new parliamentary government. Faced with increasing problems, Mujib took tighter control and assumed the presidency in January 1975. He along with most of his family, was killed in a coup d'etat just seven months later. His daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, who was out of the country at the time of the overthrow, later served as prime minister of Bangaldesh (1996-2001; 2009-).

								Following the assassination of the Father of the nation, succeeding governments offered low-key commemorations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Restoration of his public image awaited the election of an Awami League government in 1996, which was led by his eldest daughter, Sheikh Hasina, the leader of the party.

								15 August has since been commemorated as "National Morning Day". The country keeps it flags lowered to half-mast in this day as a sign of mourning. In 2016, the Awami League government passed a law that criminalized any criticism of Mujibur Rahman.
